"""FileCheck package initialisation.

This package relies on the ``slots=True`` feature of ``@dataclasses.dataclass``
which only became available in Python 3.10.  When the library is imported on
an earlier interpreter (e.g. Py-3.9 used by the current test-suite) we patch
``dataclasses.dataclass`` so that the same source code continues to work and
the *effective* behaviour is preserved:

* The additional ``__slots__`` tuple is injected so instances do not obtain a
  per-instance ``__dict__``.
* All other keyword arguments are forwarded unchanged to the original
  decorator so that ordering, immutability, etc. keep functioning exactly as
  before.

The patch **must** run *before* any sub-module that uses
``from dataclasses import dataclass`` is imported, therefore it lives in the
packageâ€™s ``__init__.py`` which is executed first during the import process.
