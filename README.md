# filecheck - A Python-native clone of LLVMs FileCheck tool

This tries to be as close a clone of LLVMs FileCheck as possible, without going crazy.

There are some features that are left out for now (e.g. [pseudo-numeric variables](https://llvm.org/docs/CommandGuide/FileCheck.html#filecheck-pseudo-numeric-variables) and parts of [numeric substitution](https://llvm.org/docs/CommandGuide/FileCheck.html#filecheck-numeric-substitution-blocks)).
